- Ex1. FizzBuzz (function must return a list of the solution e.g n=5 ---> ["1", "2", "fizz", "4", "buzz"])

   if number is divisible by 3 then it must be replaced with "fizz"
   if number is divisble by 5 then it must be replaced with "buzz"
   if number is divisible by 3 and 5 then it must be replaced with "fizzbuzz"

- Ex2. Leap Year checker (function must return a boolean)

	To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps:

    	If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
    	If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
    	If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
    	The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
  	The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).

- Ex3. Write a program that arranges three numbers in ascending order without using max or min or sort functions incl. sets 
(function must return a string like this ----> "minNumber middleNumber maxNumber")

- Ex4. write a program with a function that takes in a number and returns that number in reverse wthout using built-in sort functions (eg. 19 ---> 91)
